## Introduction
This package contains the CCS811 air quality sensor and the BME680 temperature, pressure and humidity sensor.

You can see my BME680 C driver here: https://github.com/franmartinv/BME680_C_driver

The sensor driver package includes CCS811.c and CCS811.h files.


## Integration details
* Integrate CCS811.c and CCS811.h file in to the project.
* Include the CCS811.h file in your code like below.
``` c
#include "CCS811.h"
```

## File information
* CCS811.h : This header file has the constants, function declarations, macros and datatype declarations.
* CCS811.c : This source file contains the definitions of the sensor driver APIs.

## Supported sensor interfaces
* SPI 4-wire	:	SDI, SDO and CSB pins
* I2C			:	SDA and SDC pins
* WAK pins		: 	connect to GND to wake up the sensor

SPI 3-wire is currently not supported in the API.
## Usage guide
### Initializing the master
First you need to initialize the I2C master with:
```c
hal_i2c_init();
```
### Initializing the sensor
Then initialize the sensor using:
```c
CCS811_init(mode_number);
```

You need to give it the mode number of the sensor.

#### Example for I2C
Create some UINT8_T variables to save TVOC and eco2, and the call the function:
```c
CCS811_read_CO2_TVOC(mode_number, &eco2, &TVOC);
```

### Sensor data units
> Both of sensor variables are read in ppm


### Templates for function
